This is not displayed in the Death List on the DF-AI report, leading to the apparent impossibility of dwarves dying twice. The event is also stubbed out in the historical figure record. As a first step, this function should probably output a \"$hf came back to life as a $df::ghost_type\" message.\nhttps://github.com/BenLubar/weblegends/blob/c24bc3c45ef481d982699852ccc138c1bd31a66b/helpers_event.cpp#L2235\n\nThis death message appears when a ghost is removed from play by way of a memorial being created for it, so \"put to death\" is probably not appropriate, maybe \"laid to rest\"?\nhttps://github.com/BenLubar/weblegends/blob/c24bc3c45ef481d982699852ccc138c1bd31a66b/helpers_event.cpp#L637","files":null}]}
